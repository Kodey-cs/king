          <li>Mercury</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system and the eighth in
          size and mass. Its closeness to the Sun and its smallness make it the
          most elusive of the planets visible to the unaided eye. Because its
          rising or setting is always within about two hours of the Sun’s, it is
          never observable when the sky is fully dark. Mercury is designated by
          the symbol ☿.

        <h2>
          <li>Venus</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Venus, second planet from the Sun and sixth in the solar system in
          size and mass. No planet approaches closer to Earth than Venus; at its
          nearest it is the closest large body to Earth other than the Moon.
          Because Venus’s orbit is nearer the Sun than Earth’s, the planet is
          always roughly in the same direction in the sky as the Sun and can be
          seen only in the hours near sunrise or sunset. When it is visible, it
          is the most brilliant planet in the sky. Venus is designated by the
          symbol ♀.

        <h2>
          <li>Earth</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Earth, third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the
          solar system in terms of size and mass. Its single most outstanding
          feature is that its near-surface environments are the only places in
          the universe known to harbour life. It is designated by the symbol ♁.
          Earth’s name in English, the international language of astronomy,
          derives from Old English and Germanic words for ground and earth, and
          it is the only name for a planet of the solar system that does not
          come from Greco-Roman mythology. Earth is part of the "observable
          universe," the region of space that humans can actually or
          theoretically observe with the aid of technology. Unlike the
          observable universe, the universe is possibly infinite.

        <h2>
          <li>Mars</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mars, fourth planet in the solar system in order of distance from the
          Sun and seventh in size and mass. It is a periodically conspicuous
          reddish object in the night sky. Mars is designated by the symbol ♂. 
          Sometimes called the Red Planet, Mars has long been associated with
          warfare and slaughter. It is named for the Roman god of war. As long
          as 3,000 years ago, Babylonian astronomer-astrologers called the
          planet Nergal for their god of death and pestilence. The planet’s two
          moons, Phobos (Greek: “Fear”) and Deimos (“Terror”), were named for
          two of the sons of Ares and Aphrodite (the counterparts of Mars and
          Venus, respectively, in Greek mythology).

          <li>Jupiter</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter, the most massive planet of the solar system and the fifth in
          distance from the Sun. It is one of the brightest objects in the night
          sky; only the Moon, Venus, and sometimes Mars are more brilliant.
          Jupiter is designated by the symbol ♃.

        </h2>
        <p>
          Saturn, second largest planet of the solar system in mass and size and
          the sixth nearest planet in distance to the Sun. In the night sky
          Saturn is easily visible to the unaided eye as a non-twinkling point
          of light. When viewed through even a small telescope, the planet
          encircled by its magnificent rings is arguably the most sublime object
          in the solar system. Saturn is designated by the symbol ♄.

        <h2>
          <li>Uranus</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Uranus, seventh planet in distance from the Sun and the least massive
          of the solar system’s four giant, or Jovian, planets, which also
          include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. At its brightest, Uranus is just
          visible to the unaided eye as a blue-green point of light. It is
          designated by the symbol ♅.

          <li>Neptune</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Neptune, third most massive planet of the solar system and the eighth
          and outermost planet from the Sun. Because of its great distance from
          Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. With a small telescope,
          it appears as a tiny, faint blue-green disk. It is designated by the
          symbol ♆.
